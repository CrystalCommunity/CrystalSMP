# CrystalSMP
An anarchy smp server with different abilities

## What is the scope of this SMP?

### The gems
Forget the boring Vanilla minecraft. In this smp you will get 1 out of 5+ Gems. Each gem has it's own special powers, some of them are passive, which means it doesn't affect enemy players, or mobs but you can use it for your own advantages. If you are really into PvP then there is a chance you can get one of the Attack gems, which can really make PvPs and PvEs more fun.
Don't be sad if you didn't get the gem you wanted to get, there would be multiple options to reroll yourself into a new one!

### Teams
You can either join to a team, or just play by your own. We suggest joining into a team that could save you from enemy players, or other potential dangers, but it is up to you. You can even create your own team, which you can do in our Website.

Making your own team will grant you some advantages, for example every month you will get 2 reroll item, which you can use yourself, or give it to your teammates. For further informations about the advantages please join out Discord server!

### Anarchy
The server itself is an anarchy server, so there wouldn't be much rules. You can make whatever you want, raid bases, steal from enemies. This smp doesn't contain any kinds of protection for your buldings, so it is up to you on how you defend or hide your base.

## Main functions
- The server will restart every midnight!
- The server will reset every month! (Which means a there will be a completely new seed and all players inventory and enderchests will be cleared as well.)

## The dragon egg
The player who first grabs the dragon egg will gain some power over everyone. 

This player can either choose between placing the egg, which will then RESET everyone's stats back to 0, or he/she can activate it to gain the Dragon gem.

## Further informations
